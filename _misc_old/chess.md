Challenge me on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/mapaf2/0)!

I started playing chess at the age of 12 or 13 and participated in a few dozen tournaments between the ages of 13 and 18. 

After a ten-year break from tournaments, I finished 2nd at Granby 2021 and won my category at the Tournoi du Carnaval 2023!
