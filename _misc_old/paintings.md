With the recent introduction of DALL·E in the Chat-GPT API and the ability to import images, I was intrigued by how well GPT could describe an image and use the text description to prompt DALL·E in order to reconstruct the original image. In other words, using GPT-DALL·E as a multimodal encoder-decoder, where GPT is the encoder and DALL·E the decoder.

Here are a few results using some of my paintings!

<b>GPT</b>:
"A textured painting showcasing three apples placed against a subtly undulating gray background. On the left is a shadowy green apple, its muted tones blending into the backdrop. In the center, a vibrant red apple steals focus with its rich color and detailed surface, casting a soft shadow to the right. Adjacent to it is a luminous yellow apple, its bright hue contrasting with its surroundings. The interplay of light and shadow, along with the detailed brushwork, gives depth and dimension to each apple."

<b>GPT</b>:
"A detailed painting of a solitary, glowing candle with a bright, fiery orange flame atop. The candle is deep red, exhibiting wax drips and subtle texture, casting a soft luminescent glow. The background is a rich, velvety black that contrasts sharply with the candle's warmth, creating an ambiance of solitude and tranquility."

<b>GPT</b>:
"A serene painting of a coastal scene under a moonlit sky. A brilliant white moon illuminates the cerulean blue sky filled with scattered, fluffy white clouds. Perched on a lush, green hill atop a rocky cliff is a tall, white lighthouse with a glowing amber light, flanked by two quaint houses with red and gray roofs. Below, the vast sea glistens with various shades of blue, reflecting the moonlight in a mosaic of shimmering white and yellow patches, suggesting the gentle movement of waves."

<b>GPT</b>: "An impressionistic painting of a starry night sky with a bright moon, two large rounded structures in the foreground resembling stones or orbs with textured surfaces, and a vibrant grassy meadow filled with multicolored flowers at the base. The color palette should be dominated by blues, greens, and hints of red and yellow."

Not bad!
