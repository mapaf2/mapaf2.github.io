<b> Short Bio </b><br>
Hi, I'm a continuous learner especially interested by Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Biology and Agtech. I'm in the final year (months?) of my Ph. D., supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=JycXWO0AAAAJ">Brahim Chaib-draa</a>, where I conducted research on Few-shot and Continual Learning to enhance the <b>Adaptability</b> and <b>Extensibility</b> of deep neural networks (see my <a href="http://mapaf2.github.io/writings/2023-Thesis-Proposals">Ph. D. thesis proposal</a> for more details). <br><br>

In 2022-2023 I worked on the vision module of the robotic harvesting system <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT353mpnCWk">SAMI 4.0</a> and collaborated with research groups from <a href="https://www.irrigationlab.com/">UC Davis</a>, <a href="https://ece.montana.edu/directory/faculty/2110159/bradley-whitaker">Montana State University</a> and  <a href="https://www.agronomy.k-state.edu/about/people/faculty/jha-gaurav/">Kansas State University</a> on a project of remote sensing to predict evapotranspiration in agricultural fields of California. <br><br>

Prior to that I earned a Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics, during which I had the opportunity to work on a research project with Prof. <a href="http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~hardy/">Simon Hardy</a> on the computational modeling of a molecular pathway responsible for synaptic plasticity.</p>

<!-- My interests towards programming and agriculture go back to when I learned HTML, PHP and SQL at the age of 13-14, <i>hoping</i> to create a web-based simulation game of farming. I then tinkered with fun projects in C/C++ throughout my teenage years up to university. 
I did a bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics, where I became fascinated by the process of learning. In the last year of my undergraduate studies, I did a research project with Prof. Simon Hardy on the computational modeling of a molecular pathway responsible of [long-term synaptic plasticity](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain/brain-physiology/what-synaptic-plasticity). 
After studying <i>biological learning</i>, I then specialized in <i>machine learning</i> at the Master's degree, supervised by Prof. Brahim Chaib-draa. I worked on multimodal emotion recognition, mixing Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to categorize social media content.
I pursued a Ph. D. on Few-shot Learning and Continual Learning, aiming to contribute to the adaptability and extensibility of deep neural networks. -->
