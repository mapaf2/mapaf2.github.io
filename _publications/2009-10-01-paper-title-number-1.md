excerpt: 'We combine numerical simulations of differential equations, which produce the individual trajectories of protein concentrations, and structural analysis of the reaction network with Petri nets. Biologists wonder how two brief calcium influxes of 1
second each can lead to this long activation downstream. With our computational approach, we explore a simple hypothesis for the response of
mTOR, the crosstalk between the Akt and Wnt pathways, with two different models.'

Signaling networks in the mammalian cell are complex systems. Their dynamic properties can often be explained by the interaction
of regulatory network motifs. Mathematical modeling is instrumental in
explaining how these systems function. To accomplish this task in this
paper, we combine numerical simulations of differential equations, which
produce the individual trajectories of protein concentrations, and structural analysis of the reaction network with Petri nets..
