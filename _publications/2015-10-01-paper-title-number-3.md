excerpt: 'In this paper we propose a method based on a multitask framework to combine multimodal information when it is

for analyzing the text, another for analyzing the image, and another performing the prediction by fusing both
modalities.'

Multimodal sentiment analysis has recently received an increasing interest. However, most methods have
considered that text and image modalities are always available at test time. This assumption is often violated
in real environments (e.g. social media) since users do not always publish a text with an image. In this
paper we propose a method based on a multitask framework to combine multimodal information when it is
available, while being able to handle the cases where a modality is missing. Our model contains one classifier
for analyzing the text, another for analyzing the image, and another performing the prediction by fusing both
modalities. In addition to offer a solution to the problem of a missing modality, our experiments show that this
multitask framework improves generalization by acting as a regularization mechanism. We also demonstrate
that the model can handle a missing modality at training time, thus being able to be trained with image-only
and text-only examples.
