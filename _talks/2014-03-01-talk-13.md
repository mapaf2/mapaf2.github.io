How do Convolutional Neural Networks analyze images and are able to classify high-level concepts from low-level pixel information? These architectures are often presented in analogy with the hierarchical visual system of animals, speculating that the first layers of a CNN typically detect "<i>the presence or absence of edges</i>", intermediate layers form "<i>motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges</i>", and finally the last layers "<i>assemble motifs</i>" to "<i>detect objects as combinations of these parts</i>". However, this <i>Shape Hypothesis</i> is challenged by an alternative perspective: the <i>Texture Hypothesis</i>. The latter is less discussed, less <i>sexy</i>, yet more plausible.
