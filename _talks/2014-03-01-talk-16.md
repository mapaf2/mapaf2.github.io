In this seminar I present the prototype of a project, Class-Agnostic Object Segmentation (CAOS), that uses self-attention to learn local representations. I discuss the idea from four different perspectives: 1) clustering, 2) few-shot learning, 3) compositionality and disentanglement, and 4) graph theory. I show promising preliminary results.
