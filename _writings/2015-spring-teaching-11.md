In our Ph. D. researches, we investigated these problems by working on few-shot learning and
continual learning. Our work aimed to contribute to the adaptability and extensibility of deep neural
networks. Specifically, we proposed a few-shot learning method which leverages contextual relations
and multimodal representations to learn better class prototypes, allowing to adapt to novel tasks with
only a few examples. Moreover, we worked on class-incremental learning, which aims to allow deep
learning models to extend their knowledge by learning new classes without loosing the ability to solve
previously learned tasks.
