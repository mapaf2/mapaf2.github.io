In this work, we propose a novel technique for the fusion of textual and visual information based on the outer product between both vectors of representation. Instead of concatenating the feature vectors as traditional approaches do, the outer product operation creates a matrix in which each pair of features are fused. It creates a richer fused representation with no additional parameters. This matrix is further analyzed by a small Convolutional neural network to capture more complex interactions between modalities.
