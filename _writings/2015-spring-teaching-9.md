In this work, we explore recent developments of visual and textual sentiment analysis, where the goal is to recognize if a source of data conveys a positive or a negative emotion. We explain the problem of affective gap, and how the combination of two modalities (texts and images) is a promising avenue towards solving it. We discuss several ideas supporting the potential value of leveraging different modalities with deep learning algorithms, while giving an overview of some techniques of data fusion. Finally, we speculate by proposing some avenues that could be interesting for future work.
